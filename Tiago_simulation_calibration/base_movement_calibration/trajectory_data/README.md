This folder contains all the recorded data from both real robot (found in the "real" folder) and simulated robot (found in the "simulation" folder).

Additionally, these folders contain a bunch of data processing scripts that extract the data from the recorded bag files.

You don't really need to deal with this unless you try to record new data and want to recalibrate the robot.
