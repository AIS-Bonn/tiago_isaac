This folder contains scripts for comparing real data with simulated data in terms of the trajectories driven.
We try here to evaluate how much differently the simulated robot and the real robot are driving.
But note that the plotted results may be misleading, depending on which kind of command was used, due to the way we aligned the data. Please interpret all of this with a grain of salt.
